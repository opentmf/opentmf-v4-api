/**
 * An identification of an entity that is owned by or originates in a software
 * system different from the current system, for example a ProductOrder handed
 * off from a commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
 * identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the system
 * (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within the system. It is
 * anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held for a single entity, e.g.
 * if the entity passed through multiple systems on the way to the current
 * system. In this case the consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the
 * array in reverse order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the
 * list.
